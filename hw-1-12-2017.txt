1.Absoute vs Relative Paths.

Answer: 5. cd ~   7. cd ~/data/..  8. cd   9. cd ..

Because ~ command stands for the user's home directory as /Users/amanda

cd .. command function as going back to the previous directory.

cd command functions that go to user's home directoy.

cd ~/data/.. functions as same as cd ..


2.Relative Path Resolution.

ls ../backup, then currently user is on the thing directory.

.. commands direct it to upper level of directiory, so it directs to

Users. After that move to backup directory as /backup, and then

it displays subdirectories in the back up.

Therefore, answer is 4: "origianl pnas_final pnas_sub"  


3. ls Reading Comprehension.

Answer is 2,3, and 4. but not 1. because ls pwd command doesn't show
the name of a directory, but only showing User's current directory.
Every other commands show three subdirectories of 'backup'.
 
4. Exploring More ls Arguments
The -l arguments makes ls use a long listing format, showing not only the file/directory names but also additional information such as the file size and the time of its last modification.

The -h argument makes the file size “human readable”.

5.Listing Recursively and By Time

The directories are listed alphabetical at each level, the files/directories in each directory are sorted by time of last change.
